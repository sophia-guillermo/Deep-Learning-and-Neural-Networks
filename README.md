# Objective and goal of the project
I aim to develop a model capable of accurately classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into their respective categories (e.g., Trouser, Pullover, Dress). With the exploration of different model architectures, my goal is to pick the best model that can effectively distinguish between the different fashion items, not just achieving a high degree of accuracy in its predictions but to also generalize well to unseen images.
